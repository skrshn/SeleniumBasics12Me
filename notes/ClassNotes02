Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
internal view of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or Dev tools
Document --> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel..
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinktext
- CSS Selector
- Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple -- tags || button, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue --> attribute value


Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g. linkText and partialLinktext are only used for links

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag


if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates
